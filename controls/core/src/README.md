# Secure your codebase

Your code is one of your most valuable asset, you want to be sure things are
running smoothly and in a predictable way.

## Why does it matter?

A proper development lifecycle insure your application is iterated on in a
secure and systematic manner. It reduces the chances of error or vulnerabilities
and so increase the stability, integrity and security of your software. Also, it
helps you scale your engineering team.

## How can I proceed?

- **Communicate policies:** Publish and update key documents and services.
- **Implement structured processes:** Define a development lifecycle for
  software, adopt Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), and deploy configuration
  management systems to maintain consistency and security.
