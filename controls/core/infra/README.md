# Secure your infrastructure

## Why does it matter?

Your infrastructure holds your sensitive data and makes sure your service is
available to your customers. Protecting it from unauthorized access or attacks
is key to prevent any data leak or service outage.

## How can I proceed?

To secure your infrastructure, you will need to:

1. Understand what your are protecting
2. Regulate access
3. Log changes
4. Fix known vulnerabilities
