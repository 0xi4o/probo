# Remove unauthorized assets

## Purpose

Outdated/unmonitored/etc.. assets (VMs, Buckets, etc..) pose a significant risk:

- They can be used for malicious activities
- You donâ€™t manage them, they could lack proper security measures.

## Implementation

Review the list of authorized asset you created
[List of your assets](./COR.INF.001_list_your_assets.md) , identify the ones
that should not be there, and select the proper action:

- Disconnect the asset from your network
- Scan for security updates on the asset and ensure proper access control
