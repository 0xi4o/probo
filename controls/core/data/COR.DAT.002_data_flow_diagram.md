# Help the auditor with a data-flow diagram

## Purpose

The auditor doesnâ€™t know your company and your systems. Providing him with a
diagram that show all account data accross your systems & networks will enable
him/her to understand your challenges faster and also to better evaluate your
tradeoffs (when needed). It will also help you be 100% clear on how you process
your data, and help with onboarding.

## Implementation

Create a diagram that captures all systems and networks handling data in your
environment.

On this diagram, map out data flows:

- entry and exit points
- processing steps
- storage locations

## Evidence

- Data flow diagram
