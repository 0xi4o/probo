# Protect your Network

Your network connects your devices, servers, and systems.

## Why does it matter?

Protecting your network is essential for the data and services your company
provides. Network security helps ensure that sensitive data is accessible only
to authorized users and that systems remain operational and resilient to
attacks.

## How can I proceed?

Strengthening network security in a targeted, efficient way is essential. By
restricting access to infrastructure, implementing protective layers like
Cloudflare, and conducting regular security assessments, you can effectively
safeguard your systems against unauthorized access and potential attacks.
