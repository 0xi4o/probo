# Toward SOC 2

## Not everything is mandatory

You know better than anyone (including the auditor) what is best for your
company. You might have good reasons for performing or not a task as every
company is unique.

To help you evaluate the importance of each tasks you will run into, they are
labelled with three levels:

- **Mandatory** ‚Äì The essential and fundamental elements. If you don‚Äôt have
  those, your auditor or customer will ask questions, you better justify it.
- **Optional** ‚Äì Your auditor or customer might ask questions if any of those
  elements are necessary to mitigate a risk you have.

    A good example is penetration testing.
    
    - Penetration tests are expensive, but they can be a good investment, especially if you are running into a prospect requiring it
    - However they probably wont make sense if you are at the MVP stage and you are gonna trash and rebuild your product in a few month
    </aside>

- **Advanced** ‚Äì They show a great commitment toward security. Unless it is the
  only way to mitigate a risk very specific to your company, you won‚Äôt be asked
  about it.

## What‚Äôs next ?

- **Pro tip:** Setup screenshot to clipboard You will have to take quite a lot
  of screenshot until we automate most of it. We recommend that you setup a
  screenshot to clipboard so you can just take a screenshot and paste-it saving
  you ton of time. On mac:

      - Use **CMD + SHIFT + 5** to enter screenshot mode
      - Click options, to change ‚Äúsave to‚Äù to ‚Äúclipboard‚Äù
      - Now you can use **CMD + SHIFT + 3** to take a screenshot to clipboard
      - And paste it in the right place with **CMD + V**
