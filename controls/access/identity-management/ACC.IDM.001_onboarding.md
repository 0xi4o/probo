## Purpose

It is the perfect timing to ensure that every employees has:

- accepted and signed all documents
- the access needed to perform his/her tasks
- started his/her security training

## Implementation

In theory, you already have an onboarding plan for your new employees (if not,
Onboarding for new joiner](data/onboarding-for-new-joiner.md)) and a to-do for
your admin running the onboarding (if not,
	[Onboarding admin checklist](templates/onboarding-admin-checklist.md)).

On your employee to-do, be sure to include:

- Set-up of 2FA
- Set-up of password manager
- Read & acknowledge all policies (it can be part of the contract)
- Complete the security training

On your admin to-do, be sure to include:

- contract is signed before granting access
- apply “least privilege principle” for access (the matrix you defined)
- Force the set-up of 2FA and password manager
- Initiate the security training
