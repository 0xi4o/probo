## Purpose

Yes, people will leave your company (either by your decision or
theirs). And you want to be prepare! If an early employee leaves and
you forgot to change the ownership on his/her document, you might lose
the documents.

Also, you want to be sure people can’t access the company data or
systems once they left!

## Implementation


1. Integrate the following elements in your offboarding checklist:
   - Return of company assets (laptop etc.)
   - Transfer ownership of documents
   - Revoke all access to systems

	(if you don't have an offboarding checklist → [Offboarding admin checklist](data/offboarding-admin-checklist.md))

2. Upload a screenshot of your checklist that contains those bullet
   points below
