## Purpose

When recruiting someone, you want to be sure of who you are hiring: by
performing reference checks (it can also be background checks), you
add an additional layer of certainty on the candidate by looking for
potential red flags in the candidate’s past (history of unethical
behavior, harassment, fraud, etc..).

## Implementation

Recruitment is key, especially early stage, so you are probably
already doing it right, it is only about documenting it.

⇒ Define the recruitment process you follow when bringing on a new
member (if you don’t have one formalized, here is a structure:
[Recruitment process](data/recruitment-process.md)).

## Evidence

- Reference check template
- Completed check records (redacted)
- Process documentation
- Verification records
