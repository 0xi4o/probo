# Run performance reviews

## Purpose

Makes sure your team has the skills and focus needed to protect what matters
most in your business. They help spot training gaps, reinforce accountability
and ensure everyone is aligned with your operational goals - security being one
of them. It's all about building a culture that proactively minimizes risks
while continuously improving.

## Implementation

Create a simple employee
[performance evaluation process](templates/performance-review-process.md). It
must rely on clear metrics and expectations and must be run at least once a
year.

## Evidence

- Screenshot of your performance review process.
