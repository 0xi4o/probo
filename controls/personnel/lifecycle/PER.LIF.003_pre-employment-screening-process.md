# Know your recruits

## Purpose

When recruiting someone, you want to be sure of who you are hiring: by
performing reference checks (it can also be background checks), you add an
additional layer of certainty on the candidate by looking for potential red
flags in the candidate’s past (history of unethical behavior, harassment, fraud,
etc..).

## Implementation

Recruitment is key, especially early stage, so you are probably already doing it
right, it is only about documenting it.

⇒ Define the recruitment process you follow when bringing on a new member (if
you don’t have one formalized, here is a structure:
[Recruitment process](templates/recruitment-process.md)).

## Evidence

- Reference check template
- Completed check records (redacted)
- Process documentation
- Verification records
