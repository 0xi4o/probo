# Set up your employees for success

## Why does it matter?

Without the proper security measures in place, employees can inadvertently
expose your company to breaches and vulnerabilities. Providing secure access and
clear guidelines on handling sensitive information is crucial to protect your
organization from potential threats.

## How can I proceed?

You will focus on two things:

- **Processes:** whether it is to recruit, onboard or off-board, things are
  prepared and you are sure not to forgot anything.
- **Enabling**: empower your employees to take the best decision possible to
  maintain your security posture
