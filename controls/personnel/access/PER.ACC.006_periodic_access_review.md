# Conduct an access reviews

## Purpose

A formal/explicit process to review employee access on a quarterly/yearly basis
is a must have in terms of security hygiene.

## Implementation

Every 3 or 6 months, plan an “Access review session” with the relevant people to
audit accesses on all systems (that is another good reason to enable SSO). You
need to ensure everyone has the proper access for his/her job - an account
inactive for the last 90 days can probably be disable. If you proceed to any
change, document it in the minutes of the meeting - those minutes will be asked
for subsequent SOC 2 audits.

## Evidence

- Screenshot the recurring meeting invite OR the notes from the previous reviews
