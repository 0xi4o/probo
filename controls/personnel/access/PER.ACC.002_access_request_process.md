# Access Request Process

## Purpose

In order to minimize the threat of someone getting access to something they
should not, we follow the continuous update principle: making sure the
privileges are up to date. We need to setup a proper process to define how we
grant and revoke access to different systems.

## Implementation

We will formalize your access granting and revocation policy later, for that, we
need you to implement the fitting process for you.

1. Setup an easy process to update the access outside of onboarding and
   offboarding:
   1. Define who in your leadership team should be the person granting access.
      It usually would be someone from HR or IT
   2. Go to Slack and create an `access-request` channel
   3. Ensure any access request goes through this slack channel so you can
      provide screenshots of those requests.

> Pro tip: Setup an alias to @access-admin that pings the right person in charge
> to reduce notification noise

## Evidence

- Screenshot of the slack channel with some actions on it.
