# Configure your system access

You can start by making sure you properly manage access to your company system
and data.

## Why does it matter?

Someone having access to something he should not can have serious consequences
such as a data leak or a service interruption. It is important to mitigate those
risks you have identified previously.

## How can I proceed?

The main idea is to follow those principles:

1. **Least privilege:** everyoneâ€™s access is limited to what's necessary for job
   duties
2. **Secure:** nobody can easily get access to the your employees
   passwords/access
3. **Continuous update:** making sure the privileges are up to date and you use
   the latest best practices
