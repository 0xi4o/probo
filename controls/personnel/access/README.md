# Configure your system access

You can start by making sure you properly manage access to your company system
and data.

## Why does it matter?

Someone having access to something he should not can have serious consequences
such as a data leak or a service interruption. It is important to mitigate those
risks you have identified previously.

## How can I proceed?

The main idea is to follow those principles:

1. **Least privilege:** everyoneâ€™s access is limited to what's necessary for job
   duties
2. **Secure:** nobody can easily get access to the your employees
   passwords/access
3. **Continuous update:** making sure the privileges are up to date and you use
   the latest best practices

## Mitigations

- [Enable MFA on critical services](PER.ACC.001_mfa_on_critical_services.md)
- [Access Request Process](PER.ACC.002_access_request_process.md)
- [Setup a password manager](PER.ACC.003_password_manager.md)
- [Setup Role Based Access Control](PER.ACC.004_role_based_access_control.md)
- [Enforce SSO when possible](PER.ACC.005_enforce_single_sign_on.md)
