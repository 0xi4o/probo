# Secure your emails

## Why does it matter?

Do you know what is the most common attack vector among cyber threats?
**Emails**

And by far! It is also where your employees are talking with externals. By
configuring a few things in your settings, you are preventing many threats from
reaching your employees and you are protecting your data and systems.

## How can I proceed?

To do so, we divided the work in two steps:

- You secure the access to your offices.
- You secure the internet connexion of remote employees
