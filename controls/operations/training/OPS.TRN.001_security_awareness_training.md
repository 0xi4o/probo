## Purpose

Your employees are the main target of cyber threats (especially phishing and
social engineering), and education is one of the best way to reduce risk.
Awareness of your employees will improve your company security.

## Implementation

There are a few options on the market, we will guide you through
[Riot](https://tryriot.com/fr/) setup.

### Riot

1. **Sign up:** Go to the Riot website ([tryriot.com](https://tryriot.com/)) and
   either start a free trial or book a demo to get your account set up.

2. **Install on slack**: If you’re using Slack, you can install Riot directly
   from the [Slack Marketplace](https://slack.com/apps/A01GSNM2H6V-riot).

3. **Set up phishing simulations and security training**: After installation,
   you can begin running phishing simulations to test your team’s readiness
   against attacks. You can also automate ongoing security training programs
   that run throughout the year to keep employees aware of best practices.

4. **Monitor and Track Progress**: Once the setup is complete, you can track
   your team's engagement and security posture through Riot’s dashboard, which
   allows you to monitor progress and export compliance reports as needed.
