# Test your disaster recovery plan

## Purpose

Having a plan with dust on it is useless. The goal of having a Disaster Recovery
Plan is to be able to insure business continuity. As things are moving in your
company, you need to check whether your DRP is still legit and whether you are
able to properly run it.

## Implementation

At least once a year, you need to test your DRP and, if possible, improve it.
Follow the instructions on yours and log the outcomes. Did it work?

## Evidence

- Link to the logs of your last test
