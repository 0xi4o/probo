# Manage your computers

## Why does it matter?

Your company devices have the potential to store or process data â‡’ If someone
lose his laptop or it gets compromised, it can expose you to a data leak (and a
few other things)

## How can I proceed?

You have to make sure that every device is properly set-up. To monitor things,
the easiest way is to leverage a Mobile Device Management software (MDM), but if
you are early in your development, proper guidelines are enough. On each
machine, you need:

- Screenlock is enabled
- Firewall is active
- Anti-malware detection is active
- Data is encrypted

## Mitigations

- [Configure Anti-malware Protection on Employee Devices](PHY.HW.001_endpoint_antimalware.md)
- [Configure Automatic Screen Lock on Employee Devices](PHY.HW.002_device_screen_lock.md)
- [Configure Disk Encryption and Firewall on Employee Devices](PHY.HW.003_device_encryption.md)
