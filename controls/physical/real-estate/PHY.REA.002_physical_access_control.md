## Purpose

Even if you do most of your business online, you still have offices,
computers or even printed document: you need to make sure those assets
are physically secured (we will focus on the digital access later).

## Implementation

If you are working from a coworking space or subleasing offices, you
don’t have much do to. Provide a link to their access policy and the
dashboard they probably provide to manage the list of authorized
personnel.

If you have your own office space, you need to provide:
- The security system/measure you implemented (badge, pin, etc…) -
  select the right element in the evidence section.
- The dashboard where you track authorized personnel.

## Evidence

- Access policy document from your coworking provider.
- Screenshot of the dashboard with a list of authorized personnel.
