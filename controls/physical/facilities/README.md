# Secure your offices and internet access

Start by assessing whether your team works from a physical office or operates
remotely, as this will guide your approach to securing the workspace.

## Why does it matter?

Unauthorized access to your office or network can lead to serious consequences
such as data theft, or other serious issues. Protecting both physical and
digital environments is essential to mitigate those risks.

## How can I proceed?

We break this into two main areas of focus:

1. **Office Security:** Ensure that the access to your office is secured against
   unauthorized entry.
2. **Internet Security:** Ensure that members of your teams or contractors that
   work remotely have a secure access to internet.
