# Implement Visitor Access Policies

## Purpose

Even if you do most of your business online, you still have offices, computers
or even printed document: you need to make sure those assets are physically
secured (we will focus on the digital access later) regarding visitors.

## Implementation

Nothing, it is done! The element below will be added to your access policy.

## Evidence

Visitors must be accompanied by an employee at all times when they are on
premises.
