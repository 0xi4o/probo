# Clearly explain your services

## Purpose

Here, we are not enhancing security, we are helping the auditor be more
efficient. As part of the audit, he/she will need to understand clear boundaries
for the audit, identify the relevant risk and then check how you mitigate them.

A proper service description is key for your customers, but it also help the
auditor understands what your customers are expecting from you.

## Implementation

Nothing, everything should already be on your website for customers to see.

## Evidence
