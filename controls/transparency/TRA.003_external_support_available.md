# External support available

## Purpose

External support is not required for SOC 2, but it enhances transparency by
showcasing your security practices, policies, and compliance efforts, building
trust with customers and stakeholders. - Ultimately, this is what SOC 2 is
about: reassuring your prospect and customer on how you work.

## Implementation

Create and maintain a complete list of support resources (eg. user guides,
technical documentation) for all your services.

Ensure easy access to those resources and keep them up to date.

## Evidence

- If not publicly available, drop a screenshot from your knowledge base showing
  everything you cover (especially security)
- Link to your public documentation
