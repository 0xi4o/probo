## Purpose

It ensures your project stays secure and up-to-date without manual tracking of
dependencies. It also reduces the risk of using outdated or insecure libraries
in your codebase.

## Implementation

### Github

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. On the left sidebar, click "Security & analysis".
4. Under "Dependabot alerts", ensure "Dependency graph" and "Dependabot security
   updates" are enabled.
5. GitHub will now alert you to any vulnerable dependencies and automatically
   open pull requests to fix them.
