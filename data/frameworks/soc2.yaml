        In order to minimize the threat of someone getting access to something they should not, we follow the **secure principle:** nobody can easily get access to data/systems.

        We need to ensure that if someone has access to your password, they still cannot log into your account. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds extra layers of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors beyond their passwords. The most standard solution is 2FA: your password + something else.

        Here, we are not enhancing security, we are helping the auditor be more efficient. As part of the audit, he/she will need to understand clear boundaries for the audit, identify the relevant risk and then check how you mitigate them. 

        A proper service description is key for your customers, but it also help the auditor understands what your customers are expecting from you.

        External support is not required for SOC 2, but it enhances transparency by showcasing your security practices, policies, and compliance efforts, building trust with customers and stakeholders. - Ultimately, this is what SOC 2 is about: reassuring your prospect and customer on how you work.
